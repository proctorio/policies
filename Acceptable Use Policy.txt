ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY
This Acceptable Use Policy (this “AUP”) is incorporated into and made a part of the Terms of Service (the “Terms”) that govern the use of Proctorio’s Services. Capitalized terms used in this AUP that are not otherwise defined have the meanings given in the Terms and in the applicable SaaS Agreement between Proctorio and the Institution (“Your SaaS Agreement”). This AUP applies to and is binding upon all Authorized Users and, unless Your SaaS Agreement provides otherwise, applies to and is binding upon You as an Institution. The terms in this AUP are in addition to Your obligations under the Terms and, if applicable, under Your SaaS Agreement, and the terms in this AUP do not limit, modify, reduce, or eliminate any of Your other obligations. Proctorio reserves the right to investigate any suspected abuse of this AUP.

Please direct all questions and comments about exam integrity to your Institution. Proctorio does not make any decisions related to exam integrity. All decisions regarding exam integrity are the responsibility of the Institution and its authorized representatives, including the use of room scans, which are only enabled at the discretion of the Institution. All Institution-approved representatives should first review all applicable audio, video, and screen recordings and images before making any decisions regarding exam integrity.

This AUP may be changed or modified at any time by posting a revised version on this page and noting the date of last update, at which time any changes become immediately effective. If You wish to be made aware of updates to these Terms, You may check for updates on GitHub. Institutions and their representatives are prohibited from making any negative decisions regarding exam integrity or from imposing any other negative consequence or detriment on an End User based partly or entirely on Proctorio’s analysis. Institutions and their representatives must conduct their own independent, non-automated review, and analysis of any relevant data (including any available audio, video, screen recordings, or images that were the subject of Proctorio’s analysis or that the Institution otherwise deems relevant) prior to imposing any such negative consequence or detriment.
